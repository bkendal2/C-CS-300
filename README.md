What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
	
The problems I was solving in the projects for this course was creating a program that 		would return a sample schedule and course information for college academic advisors.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures are important to understand for coding as they make it possible to write more concise and less redundant code. Data structures are all around us in every day life, we don’t even realize. Looking closely at these makes for a more efficient code and a more efficient world. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Understanding data structures was important to overcome the roadblocks I faced while going through the activities of this course. I tried my best to spend a lot of time on the Zybooks readings as well as look at Youtube videos that do a good job of summing up and visually demonstrating these concepts. This helped me push through whenever I got stuck and my code was not running. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project and this course really emphasized pseudocode and planning the program and how I’m going to write it to avoid redundant code. It also looked closely at the nature and beautiful simplicity of algorithms. This has made me think a lot about code and setting up programs in a more efficient and concise manner rather than just launching into writing it without a very good framework. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has evolved the way I write programs in thinking about the steps to go through like my discussion post of getting ready for work. To create a list and then write a program based on a concise and well-planned framework makes it easier to maintain, for other coders to read and adapt. This is very important for any program as they will almost certainly need to be tweaked and updated in future.
